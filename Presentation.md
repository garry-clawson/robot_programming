## Introduction to Problem

## Define my area of focus


## Explain what makes the problem hard

1. Occlusion

1. Lighting.

1. Lighting direction

1. Colour Gradients of greens

1. Size of grapes

1. Variation on colour of grapes

1. Shadows

1. etc ...

## Explain My Approach to the Problem

Add images here to show results at each stage and discuss limitations and problems I come across

### State Update through the program

### BUG2

1. Explain what it is and why it was chosen over BUG0 or BUG1

1. Homing Beacons

1. Obstacle Avoidance (Wall Follow)

### Vision & OpenCV

1. simpleBlobDetector
1. MorhpologyEx
1. Dilation and Opening
1. Masking
1. etc ...

## Limitations of Solution

### Algorithm

1. Homing beacons require pre defining

1. Sensor (Hoyuka) can get stuck in tight corners or edges

1. Transition through states xcan get caught in a loop

1. Distance to grapevine and Hoyuka Field of View

1. etc ...

### Environment

1. Masking and HSV values

1. Terrain - only deal sin flat land

1. Odometry requirement

1. Use of external walls (not practical)

1. Laser density can go through Grapevine and cause reading errors

1. etc ....
